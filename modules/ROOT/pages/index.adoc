== Getting started

[[node]]
=== What is a node?

The Lisk blockchain is a decentralized network that consists of many different servers, (or nodes).
Node operators are required to set up Lisk Core on a server, and then connect it to the desired network.

There are over 600 nodes around the world that are maintained by individuals, and these nodes communicate with the network.
For example, by broadcasting and receiving blocks or transactions from their peers.
In addition, Lisk nodes are also required to forge/add new blocks to the blockchain.

//@TODO: Add back when explorer/lisk desktop is available
//It is possible to view the live network statistics by accessing the following URL: {url_explorer}[Lisk’s Blockchain Explorer^].

=== Who should operate a node?

If you fall under one of the following categories listed below, then it is recommended to set up your own node:

* *Exchanges* and other services that rely on a stable API interface to the network.
* *Delegates* who have registered as a delegate and would like to actively forge.
* *Users* who do not trust external sources and want to be in full control over their node.

=== Why operate a node?

- To have a private entry point to communicate with the network.
This is especially important when running an exchange and implementing LSK tokens.
- To create your own snapshots of the blockchain.
- To create transactions and send them to the network.
- To have the option to xref:{url_config_forging}[forge] new blocks, (assuming you are an active delegate).
- To acquire full control in order to xref:{url_config}[configure] the node to your specific requirements.

NOTE: To learn how to set up a node, please see the xref:{url_getting_started}[setup overview] page.

[[networks]]
== Networks

The Lisk Core can be connected to different networks.
Please be aware that there are three key accessible public networks existing which are entirely independent of each other.
These networks are described below.

//@TODO: netowrkID of betanet needs to be updated
.Public networks of Lisk
[cols="s,3*",options="header"]
|===

| | Mainnet | Testnet  | Betanet

| Network Identifier | `9ee11e9df416b18bf69dbd1a920442e08c6ca319e69926bc843a561782ca17ee` | none | `dbc05ff4592b83c4ca36c7d87f4abc17b844b671f02bb061ae332b53e7fa1656`

| Explorer | {url_explorer}[Lisk Explorer^] | {url_explorer_testnet}[Lisk Testnet Explorer^] |  none

|===

=== Mainnet

The Mainnet is where the true Lisk economy exists.
Within this network the Lisk users can transfer LSK tokens from one account to another, register accounts as delegates; and vote for other delegates.


=== Testnet

The Testnet is an independent replica of the Lisk Mainnet, whose main function is to test the upgrades first before they are run on the Lisk Mainnet.
Subsequently, this is where new/updated versions and fixes of the Lisk Core are tested.

To start using the Testnet, please download your free LSK Testnet from the {url_faucet_testnet}[Testnet faucet^].

To connect to the Testnet via {url_lisk_desktop}[Lisk Desktop^], simply enable the "Network Switcher" in the settings and then use it to switch the network to `Testnet`.

=== Betanet

The Betanet is the place where the most recent releases of Lisk Core are tested, before moving to the Testnet and Mainnet.

To get started with participating in the Betanet, xref:{url_setup_npm}[setup Lisk Core] and follow the steps in the guides about xref:{url_management_accounts}[managing accounts] and xref:{url_config_forging}[enabling forging].
//To start using the Betanet, please download your free Betanet LSK from the {url_faucet_betanet}[Betanet faucet^]

//To connect to the Betanet via {url_lisk_desktop}[Lisk Desktop^], simply enable the "Network Switcher" in the settings.
//On the Login page, now enter `betanet.lisk.io` as custom node.

== Token

The native token for the Lisk Mainnet is the *LSK*.
Each LSK is further subdivided into 10^8^ [#index-beddows-1]#*beddows*#.

== Custom modules

Lisk Core includes the `legacyAccount` module which contains the following transaction.

=== LSK Reclaim

This transaction allows to access the balance that was sent to a legacy address without any associated public key.
Legacy addresses, generated from the first eight bytes of the public key, were used in older versions of the protocol.
This legacy address is deduced from the `senderPublicKey` of the transaction and the amount specified in the transaction asset must correspond to the amount in the legacy account.
